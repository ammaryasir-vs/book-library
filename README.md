Getting Started
In the project directory, you can run:

npm install
Installs all the necessary modules named in Package.json. 

You only need to run this command if modules are not installed, i.e. node_modules folder doesn't exist or some of the modules in node_modules folder don't exist. For example, in case you clone the project from git, it usually doesn't have node_modules because it is kept in .gitignore. So, you need this command in that case.

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
